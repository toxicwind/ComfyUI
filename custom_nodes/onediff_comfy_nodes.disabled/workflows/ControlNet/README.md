###  ControlNet Workflow
Here's some simple example of how to use controlnets. You can load this image in `ComfyUI` to get the full workflow.

**Please note**: When launching comfyui, add the `gpu-only` parameter, for example, `python main.py --gpu-only`.
#### Basic Usage
Replace `"Load ControlNet Model"` with `"Load ControlNet Model - OneDiff"` in comfyui, as follows:
![ControlNet](./controlnet_onediff.png)
#### Quantization
![ControlNet](./controlnet_onediff_quant.png)
#### Mixing ControlNet

## FAQ
- Q: RuntimeError: After graph built, the device of graph can't be modified, current device: cuda:0, target device: cpu 
  - Please use `--gpu-only` when launching comfyui, for example, `python main.py --gpu-only`.


- Q: oneflow._oneflow_internal.exception.Exception: Check failed:(xxx == yyy)
   - To initiate a fresh run, delete the files within the `ComfyUI/input/graphs/` directory and then proceed with rerunning the process.
   - **Switching the strength parameter between 0 and > 0 in the "Apply ControlNet" node is not supported.** A strength of 0 implies not using ControlNet, while a strength greater than 0 activates ControlNet. This may lead to changes in the graph structure, resulting in errors.

- Q: Acceleration of ControlNet: Not very apparent 
   - ControlNet is a very small model, In prior tests, the iteration ratio between UNet and ControlNet was 2:1.
   - UNet compilation contributed to a 30% acceleration, while ControlNet contributed 15%, resulting in an overall acceleration of approximately 45%.
   - In the enterprise edition, UNet exhibited a more substantial acceleration, making the acceleration from ControlNet relatively smaller.
