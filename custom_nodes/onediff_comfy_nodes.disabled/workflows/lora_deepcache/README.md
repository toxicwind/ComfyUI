## LoRA to Combine with DeepCache for Acceleration

We combined [OneDiff DeepCache](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/tree/main/onediff_comfy_nodes#deepcache) and LoRA, achieving more than a 2.7x acceleration for shapes of 1024*1024, workflow reference:

| -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |

However, due to the characteristics of DeepCache, combining it with LoRA introduces some differences in the output:
