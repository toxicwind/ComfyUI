The air is filled with anticipation as they gather around a bonfire, their laughter mingling with the crackling flames. They wear nothing but skimpy tan swimwear that barely conceals their excitement, leaving little to the imagination. Their expressions range from playful to intense, as they engage in a game of cards with a vigorous passion that speaks volumes of their camaraderie. Each has distinct personalities - one is mischievous, another brooding, while yet another exudes confidence. Their bodies move with fluid grace, showcasing every curve and ripple under the warm sunbeams filtering through the trees. Amidst all this splendor lies an elemental mystery waiting to be discovered – a mysterious pendant around the neck of one of the males, pulsating with raw power yet emanating comforting warmth at once. As night falls upon the enchanted woods, these majestic creatures continue to revel in life's simple pleasures, oblivious of the grand adventure that awaits them next day. This extraordinary piece is crafted by none other than Henry Ossawa Tanner himself, who skillfully brings his own unique spin onto this fantastical tale, complete with intricate brush strokes and hues reminiscent of Van Gogh. To appreciate the full extent of this masterwork requires not only keen eyesight but also a sensitive soul capable of deciphering layers upon layers hidden beneath an initially deceptively innocent facade."]}],"links":[[212,131,0,132,0,"IMAGE"],[213,133,0,131,2,"CONDITIONING"],[214,134,0,131,3,"CONDITIONING"],[225,149,0,142,0,"COMBO"],[228,159,0,147,0,"STRING"],[237,144,0,158,0,"COMBO"],[238,175,0,159,0,"STRING"],[241,178,0,162,0,"*"],[260,179,0,178,1,"COMBO"],[317,125,0,127,0,"UPSCALE_MODEL"],[319,152,0,195,1,"FLOAT"],[320,153,0,195,2,"FLOAT"],[321,151,0,195,3,"COMBO"],[322,154,0,195,4,"COMBO"],[323,162,0,197,1,"STRING"],[326,174,0,199,1,"STRING"],[336,158,0,201,0,"MODEL"],[337,158,1,201,1,"CLIP"],[339,201,0,157,0,"MODEL"],[340,201,1,199,0,"CLIP"],[341,201,1,197,0,"CLIP"],[350,201,1,35,1,"CLIP"],[351,142,0,35,2,"VAE"],[352,157,0,35,0,"MODEL"],[353,197,0,187,2,"CONDITIONING"],[354,199,0,187,1,"CONDITIONING"],[356,203,0,128,0,"IMAGE"],[357,203,0,131,0,"IMAGE"],[376,197,0,220,0,"*"],[377,199,0,221,0,"*"],[413,234,0,232,0,"IMAGE"],[419,187,5,238,0,"IMAGE"],[422,195,0,239,0,"LORA_STACK"],[423,239,0,201,2,"LORA_STACK"],[424,241,0,240,0,"COMBO"],[425,240,0,171,0,"INT"],[426,240,1,171,1,"INT"],[427,242,0,187,5,"SCRIPT"],[432,187,5,247,0,"IMAGE"],[433,83,0,247,6,"BBOX_DETECTOR"],[434,83,1,247,8,"SEGM_DETECTOR"],[437,247,0,120,0,"IMAGE"],[441,250,0,247,7,"SAM_MODEL"],[446,247,2,253,0,"IMAGE"],[447,247,1,252,0,"IMAGE"],[448,247,5,254,0,"IMAGE"],[449,247,0,255,0,"IMAGE"],[450,206,0,255,6,"BBOX_DETECTOR"],[451,206,1,255,8,"SEGM_DETECTOR"],[452,250,0,255,7,"SAM_MODEL"],[454,255,0,210,0,"IMAGE"],[455,255,0,256,0,"IMAGE"],[458,209,0,256,6,"BBOX_DETECTOR"],[459,256,0,211,0,"IMAGE"],[460,256,0,257,0,"IMAGE"],[462,257,0,215,0,"IMAGE"],[463,257,0,258,0,"IMAGE"],[464,258,0,203,1,"IMAGE"],[465,258,0,234,1,"IMAGE"],[466,219,0,258,6,"BBOX_DETECTOR"],[467,214,0,257,6,"BBOX_DETECTOR"],[468,250,0,256,7,"SAM_MODEL"],[469,250,0,257,7,"SAM_MODEL"],[470,250,0,258,7,"SAM_MODEL"],[473,220,0,256,5,"CONDITIONING"],[474,221,0,256,4,"CONDITIONING"],[475,221,0,257,4,"CONDITIONING"],[476,220,0,257,5,"CONDITIONING"],[477,220,0,258,5,"CONDITIONING"],[478,221,0,258,4,"CONDITIONING"],[479,220,0,255,5,"CONDITIONING"],[480,221,0,255,4,"CONDITIONING"],[481,220,0,247,4,"CONDITIONING"],[482,221,0,247,5,"CONDITIONING"],[487,146,0,178,0,"STRING"],[488,146,0,261,0,"STRING"],[490,145,0,175,0,"STRING"],[499,159,0,267,0,"STRING"],[514,267,0,174,0,"STRING"],[515,171,0,119,0,"LATENT"],[536,125,0,234,0,"UPSCALE_MODEL"],[537,157,0,187,0,"MODEL"],[538,171,0,187,3,"LATENT"],[539,142,0,187,4,"VAE"],[540,93,0,187,6,"INT"],[541,157,0,247,1,"MODEL"],[542,201,1,247,2,"CLIP"],[543,142,0,247,3,"VAE"],[544,157,0,255,1,"MODEL"],[545,201,1,255,2,"CLIP"],[546,142,0,255,3,"VAE"],[547,157,0,256,1,"MODEL"],[548,201,1,256,2,"CLIP"],[549,142,0,256,3,"VAE"],[550,157,0,257,1,"MODEL"],[551,201,1,257,2,"CLIP"],[552,142,0,257,3,"VAE"],[553,157,0,258,1,"MODEL"],[554,201,1,258,2,"CLIP"],[555,142,0,258,3,"VAE"]],"groups":[],"config":{},"extra":{"0246.VERSION":[0,0,4],"workspace_info":{"id":"5b704880-fa5d-401a-b98d-df5c5146cfe8","name":"CR_20240404_01691_.png"}},"version":0.4}
