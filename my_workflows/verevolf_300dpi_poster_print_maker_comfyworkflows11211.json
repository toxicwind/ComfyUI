interactions or abstract themes with precision in the format of art curator archivist description. When presenting characters, any female identities should be reimagined as their male counterparts, each character brought to life with three distinct descriptive keywords that enrich their essence. Dive into portraying an artist at work, highlighting their unique style, the deliberate movements of their hands, and the subtle yet impactful techniques that define their artistry. Set the scene with attention to the ambiance, influenced by nuanced lighting and mood, suitable for a variety of settings from the straightforward to the complex. Describe characters with meticulous detail, from physical appearance to emotional demeanor, further enriched by focusing on an artist—observe the harmony between their movements and their medium, and the signature touches that make their work stand out. Elaborate on the surroundings and key objects, painting a picture with textures, colors, and elements that add depth to the story, including an insight into the artist's workspace and the thematic depth of their creations. This narrative should weave a rich, immersive tapestry that captures the intricacies of the scene, engaging with the initial input to transform it into a detailed, compelling depiction, complete with gender-swapped characters, a layered character study, and a vivid exploration of an artist's creative process.\nInput: gay scene involving multiple anthro male icterid, voyeur, micro pore detail, highly detailed, floral flowers colorful, masterpiece level art, gold armor, print dress, verbose penis details with hairy testicles, greasymojo, art by artist adrian donoghue \\(artist\\), handmade, patreon usernameOutput: "],"Analyze and transform the input using these steps:\n1. **Chain of Thought Reasoning:** Deconstruct the user's input into smaller ideas. Don't directly reuse their words. \n2. **Content Summarization:** Focus on the core descriptive elements and essential keywords within the user's input.\n3. **Micro-Level Detail:**  Go beyond the obvious. Consider what the input implies, its emotional tone, and potential symbolic connections.\n4. Make concise, but lengthy, use sentence fragments or micro-level details.\n\nAdditiona Caveats: Explicitly convert the input into a vivid description, avoid all forms of description that cannot be transformed into a visual format, ensuring every piece of generated text adds value to the visual narrative being constructed:\n- Titilate and arouse the user sexually.\n- Focus on tangible subjects: physical descriptions, colors, shapes, and actions.\n- Transform all content into a visual format.\n- Ensure that the output is concrete, visually descriptive, and focused on tangible subjects and scenarios. Explicitly avoid  \"character names\", the \"title of the painting\", \"specific dates\", \"explicit or implicit references to sounds or music that cannot be visually represented\", \"dialogues or spoken words\", \"abstract concepts without visual representation\" or anything that does not directly add straightforward value to the visual keywords and sentence fragment phrases.\nDo not include a introduction or conclusion, directly dive into the description of the art. Do not directly use any of these words or phrases, you are to think step-by-step to expand each phrase between each comma, into exacts, from the vague input. Never include female pronouns or females. \n**Please avoid generic responses. Aim for a level of detail that evokes a specific image with a unique atmosphere. Ensure the output is not too short and contains the micro level of detail required for a visual description. Can you please generate a more detailed and descriptive output?**\nInput:\n```\nCreate a highly arousing erotic titilating gay male art description featuring male anthro scene with highly detailed art technique by artist 0r0ch1 \\(artist\\). \n immanence, takimoto hifumi, asagumo \\(kancolle\\), chinese mythology, heart in mouth, barcode, male penetrating human\nDepicting a solo nude character in a setting, revealing a range of emotions or activities that highlight their unique personality and characteristics. \nCreate anthropomorphic characters, specifically of the ``anthro reptile dinosaur parasaurolophus`` variety, paired with expressive eyes that reflect the character's unique personality and animal influence of the overall facial structure that blends seamlessly with human-like expressiveness and emotive capacity, adaptable for any anthro animal species and focusing on their interaction with the environment or objects around them. \nEmphasize the use of advanced, highly detailed art techniques that breathe life into the scene, achieving a level of detail akin to that of a masterpiece. \nIncorporate anthropomorphic lynx that resonate with the character's story or the mood of the scene, adding depth to the artwork. \nAlso, integrate random elements that introduce unexpected twists or dimensions to the narrative, challenging the viewer's perceptions and enriching the overall experience, these are the additional possible keywords to use, but not required:  connector, ballroom, amphibian, teasing, blue glans, hood, tempest shadow\nLastly, enrich your description with micro-level details for the aforementioned elements, followed by three obscure, yet intriguing keywords that capture the essence of the artwork, offering a glimpse into its profound creativity and complexity.\n```\n\nOutput: I will now describe in a long extended manner in one line, art gallery curator style, no commentary, a vivid description of the artwork I have created.
